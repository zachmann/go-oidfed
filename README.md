This repository holds a work-in-process implementation of
[OpenID Federation](https://openid.github.io/federation/main.html) in the `go` language with the goal to enable go applications to make 
use of OpenID federation.

The implementation mainly focuses on the Relying Party and Intermediate / Trust Anchor side, but not on the OP side. However, building blocks can also be utilized for OPs or other entity types.
We provide a basic library as well as a configurable and flexible 
federation entity to support higher level functionality.

- This repository contains:
    - The basic go-oidfed library with the core oidfed functionalities.
    - It can be used to build all kind of oidfed capable entities.
- The LightHouse repository at https://github.com/go-oidfed/lighthouse contains:
    - Higher level implementation for various federation endpoints
    - The LightHouse federation entity. This is a configurable and flexible 
      federation entity that can be used as a
        - Trust Anchor
        - Intermediate Authority
        - Trust Mark Issuer
        - Resolver
        - Entity Collector
        - Everything at the same time.
- The whoami-rp repository at https://github.com/go-oidfed/whoami-rp contains:
    - A simple - but not very useful - example RP.
- The OFFA repository at https://github.com/go-oidfed/offa:
    - OFFA stands for Openid Federation Forward Auth
    - OFFA can be deployed next to existing services to add oidfed 
      authentication to services that do not natively support it.
    - OFFA can be used with Apache, Caddy, NGINX, and Traefik.


### Implementation State

The library is not considered stable and some features might be missing. We encourage everybody to give feedback on 
things that are missing, not working, or weird, also suggestions for improvements and of course we are open for pull 
requests.

We try to be up-to-date with the latest version of the spec, but this might not
always be the case.


Here we try to sum up the current implementation state, (but it's very likely
that the list is not complete)
